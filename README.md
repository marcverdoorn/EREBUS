# EREBUS
EREBUS is an open-source note app that is only accessible via a password. A future goal is to encrypt the notes with AES encryption. A the moment the notes are stored as plain text and the only protection is a password. 

(Disclaimer: This is not a finished project. At the moment it does not encrypt any data, the only security is password protection.)
